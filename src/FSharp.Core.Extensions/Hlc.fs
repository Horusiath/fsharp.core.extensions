///
/// Implementation uses UTC-compatible 64bit date time representation, where top 48bits are used as a basis
/// for physical time - this allows to keep time consistency up to milliseconds. The lower 16bits are used
/// for logical component, which is used to guarantee consistency through monotonic increment if necessary.
