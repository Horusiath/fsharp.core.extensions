/// Schedule is an immutable data type, that allows to apply iterator pipeline over non-blocking delays and timeouts.
/// Schedule can put current Task/ValueTask to sleep via `Schedule.sleep` function. It can also be persisted and resumed
/// afterwards.
///
/// Core concepts involve:
///
/// - `Delay` property, which returns a next Delay computed by this schedule, or ValueNone in case when current schedule has finished.
/// - `Advance` method which returns an updated schedule with next computed value in timeline progression.
